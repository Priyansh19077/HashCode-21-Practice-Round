# HashCode-21-Practice-Round
Best score so far :) 

A – Example -> 74 points

Done by Hand

B – A little bit of everything -> 13,750 points

Sorting (more ingrediants better) then brute forcely picking up pizzas by first picking up 4, then 3 and then finally 2

C – Many ingredients -> 706,619,049 points

Sorting and then picking a subset of size X and then trying all possible cases with this X in the sorted order (X, 4), (X, 3) and (X, 2) -> increasing X increases the score -> pick the best subset -> Picking Subset increased the score by a heavy margin compared to when I was only picking up in sorted order. Cannot do much brute force as the number of pizzas is very large.

D – Many pizzas -> 7,345,043 points

Same as C

E – Many teams -> 10,369,792 points

Same as C

Total score -> 724,347,708 points
